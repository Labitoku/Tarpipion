 | Am   |


 Am                      G 
 Hello darkness, my old friend
 G                            Am 
 I've come to talk with you again
 Am                     F      C 
 Because a vision softly creeping
                         F       C 
 Left its seeds while I was sleeping
        F               F             C 
 And the vision that was planted in my brain
        C/B   Am 
 Still remains
           G        Am 
 Within the sound of silence


 N.C.                         G 
 In restless dreams I walked alone
 G                        Am 
 Narrow streets of cobblestone
 Am                  F         C 
 'Neath the halo of a street lamp
                          F         C 
 I turned my collar to the cold and damp
        F                        F                C 
 When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
               C/B   Am 
 That split the night
 C                G        Am 
 And touched the sound of silence


 Am                        G 
 And in the naked light I saw
 G                           Am 
 Ten thousand people, maybe more
 Am                   F        C 
 People talking without speaking
                    F         C 
 People hearing without listening
               F          F              C 
 People writing songs that voices never share
           C/B   Am 
 And no one dared
 C            G        Am 
 Disturb the sound of silence


 Am                          G 
 "Fools" said I, "You do not know
 G                      Am 
 Silence like a cancer grows
 Am                      F          C 
 Hear my words that I might teach you
                      F          C 
 Take my arms that I might reach you"
       F           F                 C   C/B   Am 
 But my words, like silent raindrops, fell
 C             G        Am 
 Echoed in the wells of silence


 Am                        G 
 And the people bowed and prayed
 G                     Am 
 To the neon god they made
 Am                        F       C 
 And the sign flashed out its warning
                       F      C 
 In the words that it was forming
                       F                         F                       C 
 And the sign said, the words of the prophets are written on the subway walls
             C/B   Am 
 And tenement halls
 C            G        N.C.    Am   Am 
 Whispered in the sound of silence."

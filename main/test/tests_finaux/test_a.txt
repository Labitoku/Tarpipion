 G                   Em 
 Well, I heard there was a secret chord
      G                   Em 
 That David played and it pleased the Lord
      C               D               G    D 
 But you don't really care for music, do ya
         G                  C          D 
 Well it goes like this, the fourth, the fifth
      Em                    C 
 The minor fall and the major lift
      D              B7       Em 
 The baffled king composes Hallelujah


       C          Em         C          G    D    G 
 Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah


            G                         Em 
 Well, your faith was strong, but you needed proof
     G              Em 
 You saw her bathing on the roof
     C             D              G      D 
 Her beauty in the moonlight overthrew ya
     G              C        D 
 She tied you to her kitchen chair
         Em                         C 
 And she broke your throne, and she cut your hair
      D                 B7       Em 
 And from your lips you drew Hallelujah


       C          Em         C          G    D    G 
 Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah


       G               Em 
 Well, baby, I've been here before
       G                      Em 
 I've seen this room and I've walked this floor, you know
   C                   D        G      D 
 I used to live alone before I knew ya
          G                     C     D 
 And I've seen your flag on the marble arch
      Em            C 
 And love is not a victory march
        D               B7         Em 
 It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah


       C          Em         C          G    D    G 
 Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah


             G                   Em 
 Well, there was a time when you let me know
         G           Em 
 What's really going on below
     C               D         G        D 
 But now you never show that to me do ya
       G             C       D 
 But remember when I moved in you
         Em             C 
 And the Holy Dove was moving too
      D              B7           Em 
 And every breath we drew was Hallelujah


       C          Em         C          G    D    G 
 Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah


   G             Em 
 Maybe there's a God above
     G                Em 
 But all I have ever learned from love
     C                D          G        D 
 Was how to shoot somebody who outdrew ya
          G                  C      D 
 And it's not a cry that you hear at night
      Em                  C 
 It's not somebody who's seen the light
         D              B7         Em 
 It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah


       C          Em         C          G    D    G 
 Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah
 Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah
 Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah
 Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah
 Hallelujah

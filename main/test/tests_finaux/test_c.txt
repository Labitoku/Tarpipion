 | Am   | E    | G    | D    |
 | F    | C    | Dm   | E7   |
 | Am   | E    | G    | D  |
 | F    | C    | Dm   | E7   |


 Am 
 On a dark desert highway
 E 
 Cool wind in my hair
 G 
 Warm smell of colitas
 D 
 Rising up through the air
 F 
 Up ahead in the distance
 C7 
 I saw a shimmering light
 Dm 
 My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim
 E7 
 I had to stop for the night


 Am 
 There she stood in the doorway
 E 
 I heard the mission bell
 G 
 And I was thinking to myself
               D 
 "This could be heaven or this could be hell"
 F 
 Then she lit up a candle
 C 
 And she showed me the way
 Dm 
 There were voices down the corridor
 E7 
 I thought I heard them say


 F                            C 
 "Welcome to the Hotel California
       E7 
 Such a lovely place (Such a lovely place)
       Am 
 Such a lovely face
 F                                 C 
 Plenty of room at the Hotel California
    Dm 
 Any time of year (Any time of year)
        E7 
 You can find it here"


 Am 
 Her mind is Tiffany-twisted
 E 
 She got the Mercedes-Benz
 G 
 She got a lot of pretty, pretty boys
 D 
  She calls friends
 F 
 How they dance in the courtyard
 C 
 Sweet summer sweat
 Dm 
 Some dance to remember
 E7 
 Some dance to forget


 Am 
 So I called up the Captain
 E 
 "Please bring me my wine"
          G                                    D 
 He said, "We haven't had that spirit here since 1969"
 F                                        C 
 And still those voices are calling from far away
 Dm 
 Wake you up in the middle of the night
 E7 
 Just to hear them say


 F                            C 
 "Welcome to the Hotel California
       E7 
 Such a lovely place (Such a lovely place)
       Am 
 Such a lovely face
     F                               C 
 They living it up at the Hotel California
       Dm 
 What a nice surprise (what a nice surprise)
           E7 
 Bring your alibis"


 Am 
 Mirrors on the ceiling
 E 
 The pink champagne on ice
             G 
 And she said: "We are all just prisoners here
 D 
 Of our own device"
 F 
 And in the master's chambers
 C 
 They gathered for the feast
 Dm 
 They stab it with their steely knives
         E7 
 But they just can't kill the beast


 Am                          E 
 Last thing I remember, I was

 Running for the door
 G 
 I had to find the passage back
       D 
 To the place I was before
 F 
 "Relax," said the night man
     C 
 "We are programmed to receive
 Dm 
 You can check out any time you like
 E7 
 But you can never leave!"
